# Technical Assignment
Deployment of [nginx](https://github.com/JalapalaNagaraju/niraj-assignment.git) using Infrastructure As Code(IAC) Terraform

In this exercise we will be assessing your **"GO"** skills. This repo has the **IAC** code to provision infrastructure and deploy nginx on AWS cloud using **Terraform**. 

We want you to define and write at least **3** test cases validate the newly provisioned infrastructure.

Use **Terratest** to write the test cases for the infrastructure. You can find more details of the Terratest [**here**](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/)

*Note:-* *It will take atleast 3 minutes for the ELB to serve the traffic. So plan your test case accordingly*

## Prerequisites:
- You need an AWS account with Access & Secret keys
- Install AWS-CLI, GIT, Terraform on your laptop
- Configure AWS-CLI on your laptop

## Definition of Done
- Share the test cases which you will be writing using Terratest with us
